    <h1>Classic Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="../img/spaghetti.png" alt="A plate of spaghetti bolognese" width="400" height="400">
    <p>Spaghetti Bolognese is a timeless Italian favorite that brings together the comforting flavors of slow-simmered
        ground beef, ripe tomatoes, and aromatic herbs. The sauce, known as ragù alla Bolognese, is deeply savory and
        rich, absorbing the flavors of garlic, onion, and oregano as it simmers to perfection. Served over a bed of
        perfectly al dente spaghetti noodles and topped with a generous sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, this
        dish is the epitome of a satisfying, home-cooked meal. Ideal for family dinners or cozy nights in, it's a
        universally loved recipe that never goes out of style.</p>
