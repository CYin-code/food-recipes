    <h1>Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../img/placeholder.png" alt="" width="400" height="400">
    <p>These pancakes are the ultimate breakfast comfort food—soft, fluffy, and golden-brown with a tender crumb that
        melts in your mouth. Made with a simple batter of flour, sugar, milk, egg, and butter, they come together
        quickly and cook up beautifully in a hot skillet. Whether stacked high with butter and maple syrup or topped
        with fruits, whipped cream, or nuts, they're endlessly adaptable and always delicious. Their light and airy
        texture combined with a slightly crisp exterior make them a staple for lazy weekends and brunch gatherings
        alike.</p>
