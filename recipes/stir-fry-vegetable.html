    <p>Packed with vibrant colors and crisp textures, this Vegetable Stir-Fry is a fast and flavorful way to enjoy a variety of fresh vegetables. Sliced red bell peppers, broccoli florets, carrots, and zucchini are stir-fried to perfection in a hot wok with just a splash of oil. A savory blend of soy sauce, optional oyster sauce, and a touch of sesame oil enhances the natural sweetness of the veggies while adding a rich umami depth. It's a versatile, healthy meal that's easy to customize and perfect for weeknight dinners or meal prep, especially when served over rice or noodles.</p>
